The staff members were all exceptionally friendly and professional, from the doormen and bellhops to the front-desk and concierge. I was especially grateful that Kevin, a bartender in the Ritz's off-lobby bar, was able to tie my bowtie -- I would have looked pretty foolish otherwise. He made it look perfect. Our room was spacious and comfortable, with a large bathroom and king-size bed that provided some of the best sleep I can remember in a hotel. My only disappointment was that the fitness center did not offer a sauna or steam room.",5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2012,2012-08-16,1,"Exceptional service and comfort
