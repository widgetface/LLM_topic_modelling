1,137380592,8477E11DABF4D6743885E401BB4C8CCF,Exceptional service and comfort,"Spent two nights here for a wedding in Brooklyn. The staff members were all exceptionally friendly and professional, from the doormen and bellhops to the front-desk and concierge. I was especially grateful that Kevin, a bartender in the Ritz's off-lobby bar, was able to tie my bowtie -- I would have looked pretty foolish otherwise. He made it look perfect. Our room was spacious and comfortable, with a large bathroom and king-size bed that provided some of the best sleep I can remember in a hotel. My only disappointment was that the fitness center did not offer a sauna or steam room.",5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2012,2012-08-16,1,"Exceptional service and comfort

2,129673371,483A193B7113ADFFD5CE30849564F69C,Nice room and five star service,"Great place for a 3-night stay. Our king room overlooked the pool and was very quiet. But we sure did not need the bed's heavy comforter in the Texas heat. Fortunately, there was a light blanket in the closet. 
Service could not have been better. Staff members were amazingly helpful, friendly, and knowledgable about the area. I made an online reservation the day before I wanted to arrive, and I requested a room without scenting cleaning products and away from the elevator. Staff made sure BOTH requests were fulfilled! Later when the in-room telephone misbehaved, a hotel employee was promptly there to fix it. A front desk clerk knew just where to find a nearby self-serve carwash. When the TV was blaring in the breakfast room, we were able to get the sound turned down. During our visit, we bought a new camera and accidentally trashed the camera box with the strap inside. Our garbage had just been taken out, so we asked if we could check the trash. A staff member volunteered to check the garbage, and he found the box, retrieved the strap, and had it delivered to our room in very little time!
Bonuses included the freshly baked cookies at the front desk and DVDs to check out for free (the rooms have DVD players).",5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2012,2012-05-09,1,"Nice room and five star service
